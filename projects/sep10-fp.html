            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP10 Freedom Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The topic I chose for the SEP10 Freedom Project is personal finance. Personal Finance is an important topic to cover and I was motivated by how many teenagers are ignorant of budgetting (or anything related to personal financing; based on my survey). This motivation pushed me to create a webpage.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>In the webpage, there are useful existing softwares/ hardwares are introduced <strong>(Part A)</strong>, and to make it more meaningful, I thought of a possible futuristic AI Hardware invention that may also help with the ignorance of personal finance called DroidNosMoney <strong>(Part B)</strong>. There is even a section where it shows a 3D model of DroidNosMoney.</p>
            <p>These sections are possible because I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to format the section's content to my liking, space the sections and its contents equally; no overlapping etc, and typing the information/ content. Along side the 3 major contributor, A-Frame comes into frame as it helped me create my 3D model of DroidNosMoney; A-Frame is a VR Environment where a user can code shapes into scenes and add attributes to the shape which they can distort it to their liking.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Throughout the creation process of my Freedom Project (From September to June), I've faced many challenges which resulted in crucial takeaways that shaped me into what I am today (Not a Villain, but more like a 'better' person). </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Thinking process of what the whole Freedom Project is going to be about (Purpose). This was the most difficult part as it required days of thinking and consideration before I finalized that I should address and potentially solve the issue of personal financial ignorance of teenagers.A takeaway for this can be that, Everything takes time to become more clear in one's mind as it took me a long time before I got a clear picture of what I wanted to finalize/ do.</li> <br>
                <li>Another challenge I faced was major burnouts in SEP10. Essentially, I overwork myself on all the work Mr. Mueller gives us because I wanted it to be perfect and well I wanted validation from my grade. Sometimes, I would do everything in sitting and that also didn't really help with my health. That really dropped my energy to keep pushing and learning crucial parts before creating a webpage (This was around December-January). Eventually, I took a break and thought it out which helped me regain my energy to keep pushing and get rid of the burnout I was feeling. So a takeaway I learned from this is that although I have a lot of work weighing me down, breaks are important as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If there were to be a next step for me in SEP10, I would better improve my website with JavaScript (which I will probably learn next school year in SEP11).</p>
